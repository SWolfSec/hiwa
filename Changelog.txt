--------CHANGELOG--------
Overall - Updated cookies to now be sessions instead with user and role attributes. Not invulnerable but handles better then
        Sessions did not work immediately but current updated commits are performing as intended 2019-04-06
---------------------------------------------------  
config.phplib - Did not update to avoid overall problems but ideally,
                Create /var/www/hiwa/images directory for standard images. Keeps user uploaded images separate in the /uploads folder. 
---------------------------------------------------
check.php - sanitized input with a filter for IP addresses and also used escape shell args to prevent command injection. 
            This fixes the mass command injection and disallows users from enumerating local system users. 
---------------------------------------------------            
products.php - Updated instances of pg_query to pg_query_params to limit sql injection attacks. This would fix 
                ordering multiple products without having to pay using the method shown in the first assignment.
                Naming conventions were fixed for user uploaded images to avoid overwriting hiwa.png and changing the logo. 
                Now the image will keep its temporary name and not the user supplied name. 
---------------------------------------------------  
reset.php - Blind Sql injection to enumerate users. Removed if statements causing descriptive errors. Returns same field regardless
            of username validity. Updated username check against the database to pg_query_params to further protect from sqli
---------------------------------------------------  
users.php - Updated pg_query to pg_query_params to help prevent SQL injection. Parameterized input rather than user input
            Going directly into the query. 
---------------------------------------------------  
login.php - Updated pg_query to pg_query_params to help prevent SQL injection. 
            The user is checked against the database and the sessions are updated. Updated cookies to now use sessions
            Session is granted only after a valid user and password are given as input
            Errors are non-descriptive, usernames or passwords incorrect
            ADDED updated header to each file to require login and checks role against the session instead of a cookie. 
---------------------------------------------------  
orders.php - cookies -> sessions 
---------------------------------------------------  
logout.php - No longer wipes cookies but destroys the active session
---------------------------------------------------  
menu.php - Changed how roles are set using sessions instead of cookies
---------------------------------------------------  
header.php - N/A
---------------------------------------------------  
details.php - cookies -> sessions
---------------------------------------------------  
customers.php - Updated pg_query to pg_query_params to help prevent SQL injection. 
---------------------------------------------------  
about.php - No initial changes
---------------------------------------------------  
Future recommendations - Update SQL database to use encryption for user passwords. Design reliable login system and not just 
                          rely on sessions or cookies. Make directories such as the root hiwa directory not accessible.
